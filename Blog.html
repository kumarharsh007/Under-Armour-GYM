			A self-described community of “underdogs, misfits, and mutants” ready and willing to help people with every step of their fitness journey, Nerd Fitness is a comprehensive resource that’s motivating and inspiring. Sure, they’ll teach you how to work out without a gym and how to prepare a basic meal, but they also focus on helping you fix your own mindset, develop positive habits, and really change your life one step at a time.<br>
			Ross Enamait’s website is dedicated to high performance conditioning, strength, and athletic development. The longtime trainer and boxing coach understands that a successful fitness regimen boils down to finding what works for you. His blog is a great resource for information about different kinds of training — from fitness fundamentals to old-school workouts like jumping rope to philosophical riffs on mental endurance.

Not only will you read about Pilates, but the goal of the blog is to help readers find balance in their lives by fitting in exercise, rather than trying to achieve perfection.
